lpf = low pass filter, removes all freq ≥ (parameter) hertz
lpq = how sharp that cutoff is. boosts frequencies right around the cutoff (why bruh)
delay kinda staggers sounds to make an interesting percussion audio texture pattern
release = smoothens out note changes. good for vocal sim
vowel("a") makes stuff sound bad half the time
lpf castrates any drum sound to a doot
